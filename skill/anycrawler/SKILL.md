name: anycrawler
description: Call AnyCrawler public crawl endpoints `/v1/crawl/page` and `/v1/crawl/screenshot` to fetch rendered or fetched page content, metadata, links, media, and screenshots. Use when an AI agent needs to invoke AnyCrawler with an API key, choose between `render`, `fetch`, and screenshot capture, inspect gateway credit and request metadata, save markdown or screenshot outputs, or troubleshoot public API request failures without relying on undocumented worker passthrough fields.

# AnyCrawler Crawl API

## Overview

Call the stable AnyCrawler public crawl contract only.
Prefer the bundled CLI in `scripts/anycrawler_crawl_api.py` for repeatable requests, and read `references/public-api.md` before adding fields or interpreting headers and errors.
This skill covers API invocation and documented response handling only. Do not embed target-specific SSR schema parsing examples or site-coupled extraction logic here.
The GitHub source repository for this skill is `https://github.com/myeyesareopen/AnyCrawler-Skill`.
Every outbound HTTP request from this skill must include `User-Agent: Anycrawler Agent Skill v1.0`.

## Workflow

1. Confirm `ANYCRAWLER_API_KEY` is available. Optionally use `ANYCRAWLER_BASE_URL`; default to `https://api.anycrawler.com`.
2. Choose the endpoint:
   - Use `page` for extracted page content.
   - Use `screenshot` for PNG snapshot capture.
3. Build requests only from documented snake_case fields. Do not depend on undocumented passthrough fields for `/v1/crawl/page`.
4. Send `User-Agent: Anycrawler Agent Skill v1.0` on every outbound HTTP request from this skill.
5. Run the bundled CLI instead of hand-writing HTTP requests when possible. For `page`, the CLI defaults to `method=fetch`; add `--method render` only when browser execution is needed. Use `--silent` when writing files or piping results and stdout JSON is not wanted.
6. Inspect both `data` and `meta`. `meta` mirrors gateway headers such as `requestId`, `creditsReserved`, `creditsUsed`, and `browserMsUsed`.
7. On failures, record `meta.requestId`, check `data.retryable`, and treat `400`, `401`, `402`, and most `403` responses as input or account issues rather than retry candidates. Treat `429` as quota exhaustion or rate limiting and verify account capacity before retrying.

## Endpoint Choice

- Use `page` when the user needs extracted content or structured crawl results.
- Prefer `method=fetch` first for cheaper plain HTTP retrieval when browser execution is not clearly required.
- Escalate to `method=render` when fetched content is missing expected detail, key sections appear absent, or the page likely depends on client-side or non-static loading.
- Prefer `method=render` when the target page clearly needs browser rendering, JavaScript execution, or explicit DOM readiness control.
- Use `screenshot` when the user needs `snapshot_url`, screenshot metadata, or a downloaded PNG.

## Method Decision Guide

- Start with `fetch` for simple pages, low-cost verification, and first-pass extraction.
- Stay on `fetch` when the returned content is complete enough for the task and there are no signs of client-side rendering gaps.
- Retry with `render` to confirm results when fetched output is incomplete, important fields are missing, or the page looks like a dynamic app.
- When the page needs extra time for async content, prefer `render` with `browser_wait_until=networkidle2`.
- For tasks that are not freshness-sensitive, consider `accept_cache=true` on `page` requests to reuse cached responses when available and potentially reduce credit consumption.

## Request Rules

- Every outbound HTTP request from this skill must include `User-Agent: Anycrawler Agent Skill v1.0`.
- Keep SSR follow-up handling generic here. Route target-specific SSR schema extraction to a separate extraction-focused skill or workflow instead of embedding bespoke parsing examples in this skill.
- Keep request field names in snake_case.
- Default to `method=fetch` first, then switch to `render` when content completeness or loading behavior indicates browser execution is needed.
- Use `accept_cache=true` when the task is not sensitive to the latest page state and a cached response is acceptable.
- For `page`, `browser_wait_until` only applies when `method=render`.
- For `page`, `markdown_variant=readability` still returns content in `results.markdown` and `results.markdown_tokens`.
- For `page`, `include_metadata`, `include_links`, and `include_media` must be explicitly true to expose those response sections.
- `user_agent` on `page`, plus `user_agent` and `aspect_ratio` on `screenshot`, are paid-plan-only fields.
- Do not send undocumented worker passthrough fields from older internal integrations.
