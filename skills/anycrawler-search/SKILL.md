# AnyCrawler Search

Use this skill when an agent needs public search results with low context overhead.
Prefer the bundled CLI in `scripts/anycrawler_search_api.py`.

## Preconditions

1. `ANYCRAWLER_API_KEY` must be available.
2. `ANYCRAWLER_BASE_URL` is optional; default is `https://api.anycrawler.com`.
3. Use documented snake_case fields only.

## Choose the channel

- Use `page` for general web search and source discovery.
- Use `images` when the task needs image results or visual source candidates.
- Use `news` when the task needs recent news coverage.
- Use `videos` when the task needs video results.
- Use `scholar` when the task needs scholarly or academic search results.

## Common commands

```bash
python scripts/anycrawler_search_api.py page \
  --query "site reliability engineering"

python scripts/anycrawler_search_api.py news \
  --query "AnyCrawler launch" \
  --country us \
  --language en \
  --results-per-page 20
```

## Request rules

- All channels support `query`, `country`, `language`, `location`, `page`, and `results_per_page`.
- `query` is required and must be at most 512 characters.
- `country`, `language`, and `location` are optional locale hints.
- `page` must be between `1` and `100`; default is `1`.
- `results_per_page` must be between `1` and `100`; default is `10`.
- Billing is `ceil(results_per_page / 10) * 20` credits.
- Requests are cached for 1 hour by channel, query, page, locale fields, and results count, but cache hits do not change pricing.
- Do not rely on undocumented passthrough fields.

## Response handling

Inspect both `data` and `meta`.

- Success path:
  - Check `data.ok`.
  - Read `data.results.search_parameters` to confirm the effective channel and request fields.
  - For `page`, read `data.results.organic`.
  - For `images`, read `data.results.images`.
  - For `news`, read `data.results.news`.
  - For `videos`, read `data.results.videos`.
  - For `scholar`, read `data.results.organic` first, then other populated collections.
  - Use optional `data.results.knowledge_graph`, `answer_box`, `people_also_ask`, and `related_searches` when present.
- Failure path:
  - Record `meta.requestId`.
  - Check `data.error_code`, `data.error_message`, and `data.retryable`.

## Retry rules

- Do not blindly retry `400`, `401`, `402`, `403`, or `413`.
- `409`, `429`, `502`, and `504` are the main backoff-and-retry cases.
- For `429`, treat it as quota, rate-limit, or upstream provider pressure first; back off before retrying.
- For `503`, check service configuration before retrying.

## References

- Read `references/public-api.md` for the minimal public search contract.
- Read `references/maintainer.md` only for release, billing, and full gateway details.
