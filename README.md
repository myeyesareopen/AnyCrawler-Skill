# AnyCrawler Skill for Codex ✨

This repository provides an AnyCrawler skill that can be installed directly into Codex. The current primary skill name is `$anycrawler`, which lets Codex fetch web page content, structured data, and screenshots through the AnyCrawler public API.

## 🧩 What Is This?

AnyCrawler is building a unified data access API for AI agents. The goal of this skill repository is to help Codex reuse the stable AnyCrawler public interface when handling web crawling tasks, instead of assembling ad-hoc requests or depending on undocumented fields.

This repository currently includes:

- `skill/anycrawler-crawl-api/SKILL.md`: the skill definition and workflow for `$anycrawler`
- `skill/anycrawler-crawl-api/references/public-api.md`: the stable public API contract
- `skill/anycrawler-crawl-api/scripts/anycrawler_crawl_api.py`: a lightweight CLI
- `skill/anycrawler-crawl-api/agents/openai.yaml`: agent display metadata and default prompts

## ⚙️ What Can It Do?

- Call `POST /v1/crawl/page` to fetch page content
- Choose between `render` and `fetch` modes
- Return `metadata`, `links`, and `media` when needed
- Call `POST /v1/crawl/screenshot` to generate a screenshot and return `snapshot_url`
- Output request `meta` fields such as `requestId`, `creditsReserved`, and `creditsUsed`
- Save markdown results or download PNG screenshots

## 📦 Install

The default installation path is `~/.codex/skills`. The source directory in this repository remains `skill/anycrawler-crawl-api`, but the installed skill directory should ideally be named `anycrawler` so it matches the explicit invocation name `$anycrawler`.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/myeyesareopen/AnyCrawler-Skill.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R AnyCrawler-Skill/skill/anycrawler-crawl-api ~/.codex/skills/anycrawler
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/myeyesareopen/AnyCrawler-Skill.git
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.codex\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force ".\AnyCrawler-Skill\skill\anycrawler-crawl-api" "$HOME\.codex\skills\anycrawler"
```

After installation, start a new Codex session so the new skill can be discovered again.

## 🔑 Quick Setup

Before using AnyCrawler, complete the following setup:

1. [Register or sign in to AnyCrawler](https://app.anycrawler.com/login)
2. [Create or copy an API key from the dashboard](https://app.anycrawler.com/api-keys)
3. Set `ANYCRAWLER_API_KEY` in your environment variables

### Bash

```bash
export ANYCRAWLER_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
```

### PowerShell

```powershell
$env:ANYCRAWLER_API_KEY = "sk-your-key"
```

Optional environment variables:

- `ANYCRAWLER_BASE_URL`: defaults to `https://api.anycrawler.com`

## 💬 Use in Codex

You can explicitly mention the skill in your prompt:

```text
Use $anycrawler to crawl https://example.com with render and save markdown.
```

```text
Use $anycrawler to take a screenshot of https://example.com and download the PNG.
```

If the task is clearly about calling the AnyCrawler public crawl API, Codex can also choose `$anycrawler` automatically based on the skill description.

## 🌍 Current Public Endpoints

- `POST /v1/crawl/page`
- `POST /v1/crawl/screenshot`

## 📝 Notes

- This skill targets the stable public contract only and does not depend on legacy undocumented worker passthrough fields.
- Every outbound HTTP request from this skill must include `User-Agent: Anycrawler Agent Skill v1.0`.
- Request fields should use `snake_case`.
- `anycrawler_crawl_api.py` depends only on the Python standard library, which makes it suitable for direct use in local or automated environments.
